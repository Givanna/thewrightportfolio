                <h2>Leadership: A Journey That Started Young</h2>
                <p>Leadership has always been in my DNA. Growing up with a sister who has special needs, I took on a lot of responsibilities early on. From managing the household to caring for my younger sibling, while my parents focused on my sister. It wasn’t a burden—it was a privilege. These experiences taught me the importance of empathy and efficiency, skills I’ve been sharpening at every seminar and convention I can find.</p>

The joy and sense of accomplishment that comes from seeing the final product is what keeps me going. It’s like solving a puzzle where every piece falls into place perfectly, and I just can’t get enough of that feeling.</p>

But as I navigated through different roles, I couldn’t help but notice all the ways things could be better—better leadership, more efficient processes, you name it. So, I decided to make as many changes as I could. Project management felt like the next natural step, a place where I could really make a difference.</p>
